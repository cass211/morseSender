This readme describes the format of the
configuration file, as well as your choices
as to where it will be located.

Where? And, what name?

Your choices as to where the config file is
located, are as follows:

(1) You can place the file in the same directory
as the running script, and if you do this, you
have two choices as to its name:
    (a) beeps-cfg-example.cfg or
    (b) beeps.cfg
Please note carefully that this location is the
only one where you have a choice as to its name.

(2) You can place the file in 
          $HOME/.config/beeps/beeps.cfg
and in this case, there is only one choice for
its name: beeps.cfg .

What goes in the config file?

The config file will have the following sections:
    [audio] and
    [morse]

[audio] section

The audio section will have three settings:
    sample rate = 12000
    dit_time = 0.060 (meaning 60 milliseconds)
    frequency = 440

The morse section will also have three settings:
    char_space_mult = 3
    word_space_mult = 7
    dah_mult = 3

The settings you see here are the defaults, and
if you don't have a config file, the program will
automatically set these values.

These integers will be multiplied by the
dit_time setting (audio section) to form
the time used by that event.

Here is a sample configuration file:

-- cut here --
[audio]
sample_rate = 12000
dit_time = 0.060
frequency = 440

[morse]
char_space_mult = 3
word_space_mult = 7
dah_mult = 3
-- cut here --
